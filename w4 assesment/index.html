        <h4 id='h4'>About Us & What We do <img src="photo-1532629345422-7515f3d16bb6.jpg">
           <p>Aussie Kidz Charity assists the families
            of children under the age of 18 years old that are diagnosed with 
            a disability.After years of supporting various well known kids 
            charities, Aussie Kidz Charity was started in early 2000 by a group
             of individuals disheartened by watching an increasing percentage of
              donations being used to cover overheads instead of going to the 
              ones who need it most, the Kids. With Aussie Kidz Charity, 100% of 
              the donations received are used for the children, with the running
               costs and overheads kept to an absolute minimum and looked after 
               by the Directors and friends. Since starting, we have raised over 
               $750,000 and have provided over 150 grants covering mobility aids,
               walking frames, specialised clothing and other assistance to these
                very special kids. We are focussing on gaining support and donations 
                through the generosity of Directors, individuals, corporations, 
                estate trusts and through various yearly fund raising activities. 
                These includes the Mercedes Benz Polo Championships held each 
                September and a Brisbane Businessman’s lunch held each November. 
                Aussie Kidz Charity has received the Australian Taxation Office 
                endorsement in May 2001 to allow donations over $2 to be tax
